    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Irish stew is more commonly made with lamb in Ireland.
        It's easy to prep and then let it cook slowly until the meat and vegetables are fall-apart tender and the broth
        is full of flavor. Every Irish household has its own recipe for this comforting dish and this is my mom's. It's
        perfect on a cold day or on St.
        Patrick's Day served with a pint of Guinness, of course!</p>
